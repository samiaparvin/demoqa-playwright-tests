## How to Run Tests

### PREREQUISITES:
1. [Node.js] (https://nodejs.org/) (v16 or higher recommended)
2. [Git](https://git-scm.com/) (for cloning or version control)
3. Code editor like [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

To cheak if node is installed properly open command prompt and run thsi commands -

```bash
node --version
```

```bash
npm --version
```

These command should show the current installed version.

** Create a project folder and open it in VS code. Now open terminal in that project folder location. **

### DEPENDENCIES:

1. run this command to initiate a node project and install playwright (latest) - 
```bash
npm init playwright@latest
```
**Note:** during installation select language 'JavaScript', put end-to-end test in 'tests', add github.

after installation run this command to ensure the playwright installed successfully -
```bash
npx playwright test
```
Should run the example test given successfully. If not then the browsers may not be installed. To seperately install the playwright browsers run this command - 
```bash
npx playwright install
```
This downloads the browser binaries (Chromium, Firefox, WebKit) used by Playwright.

OR

**Playwright can also be installed from VS code editor Extension.**
Go to Extension option from left menu of VS code -> search for 'playwright' and -> Install the one published by Microsoft. Then to install the playwright browser got to top meny view option -> command palette -> search 'playwright' -> click on 'Install Playwright Browsers' and -> select the browsers you wan tto intall then -> click 'ok'.

```

### Run The Tests

```bash
npx playwright test tests/test_form_functionality.spec.js tests/test_table_CRUD.spec.js tests/test_books_api.spec.js

```

To view the report run this  - 
```bash
npx playwright show-report
```

```bash
npx playwright test tests/test_form_functionality.spec.js
```

for web table CRUD function test - 
```bash
npx playwright test tests/test_table_CRUD.spec.js
```

for books APIs test - 
```bash
npx playwright test tests/test_books_api.spec.js
